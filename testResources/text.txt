Every person had a star, every star had a friend, and for every person carrying a star there was someone else who reflected it.
Just where that star above
Shines with a cold, dispassionate smile.
If in the flesh I'd travel there,
How many, many a mile!
If this, my soul, should be
Unprisoned from its earthly bond.
Time could not count its markless flight
Beyond that star, beyond!
